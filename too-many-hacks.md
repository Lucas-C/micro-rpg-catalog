# Too Many Hacks

After reading [The Black Hack](https://the-black-hack.jehaisleprintemps.net/), reviews of [Whitehack](https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/), and [Sharp Swords and Sinister Spells](www.drivethrurpg.com/product/198163/Sharp-Swords--Sinister-Spells) (yet another "Hack" system hack)...

## Hack a Character

Roll 3d6 for a series of stats, such as: STR(ength), DEX(terity), END(urance), INT(elligence), POW(er), PRE(sence)

* Set HPs (Hit Points) from the average of STR & END
* MPs from POW

In most cases, your character rolls equal or less than a stat on D20 to succeed in some effort they might reasonably attempt under pressure, given their background and inclinations. Modifiers apply to shift the stat target. A "1" always succeeds and usually grants a critical result.

Magic-using types might select two or three spell options (see Hack Magic), but lack battle experience.

When characters advance, they get a chance to raise their stats. Maybe another chance to raise a favoured stat.

## Hack Combat

Generally, roll against STR to hack at things, and DEX to avoid being hacked, or shoot something.

* Use 1d6 for lighter or improvised weapons, 1d8 for martial weapons, when you roll for damage to HP.
* Deduct Armour Reduction (AR), 1-5 (leather, gambeson, maille, half-plate, plate), from any damage you take.

Only a character with battle experience can attack and avoid in the same round (so green fighters have to choose to attack or dodge).

Creatures get HP (the GM rolls a number of dice) and Ranks that apply to rolls in combat:

* Threat Rank (TR) modifies STR and DEX
* Power Rank (PR) modifies INT or POW (for spells and other eerie stuff)

## Hack Magic
Spell casters burn MPs to launch magic. They roll against INT or POW when under pressure.

* Heal: 1 MP to heal 1d3 HP
* Blast: 1 MP to deal 1d3 damage once
* Protect: 1 MP to reduce all damage by 1 for the duration
* Enchant: 1 MP to add 1 damage for the duration, or 1 to the chance to hit
* Curse: 1 MP to reduce an enemy's TR or PR by 1 (POW roll required)
* Uncanny Ability: 1 MP to add 1 to a stat, for the purpose of accomplishing a task (sneak, persuade, search, etc.) with preternatural skill
