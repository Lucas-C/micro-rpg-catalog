# Unknown!

[Searchers of the Unknown](https://sites.google.com/site/wizardinabottle/searchers-of-the-unknown) boiled D&D down to HD, HP, AC, Damage, Movement.

Clearly a cumbersome bloat of a system.

I mean who even uses Movement? HD *and* HP? Talk about crunch city. Different ratings for different armour? *Variable weapon damage??*

I've had it with these simulation-obsessed robots ruining my hobby.

I [stripped back](https://plus.google.com/u/0/104927909965528500794/posts/L8mV2uDKxN8) Into the Odd for a bit of fun, but it seems my work isn't done. Let's get minimalist on the colossus that is Searchers of the Unknown.

**Unknown!**  
You start at **Level 1**. At the end of each session you level up, to a maximum Level 9. You start with a weapon, a tool, and an heirloom of your choice.

A **Roll** is d10 aiming for your **Level or Lower**.

**Attackers** Roll to hit the target. When a target has taken hits equal to their Level they are defeated, and must Roll or Die. Defeated beings always get an injury. Hits are recovered with a night's rest.

**Armour and Shields** can be destroyed to ignore a single hit.Â Both encumber you.

**Traps** risk out outright death or dismemberment if not handled well. Anyone who triggers a deathtrap gets a last chance to Roll or Die. In the case of other traps, the consequences are more creative.

**Artifacts** have function that's powerful, but not universally useful. Some may require a Roll to use without suffering harm. **Tomes** contain powerful spells that require complex rituals to cast.

**Monsters** have a level between 1-9 representing their general danger. They have two things that they want, a special power, and may have loot.

**Sludge Troll** (L6) - Stinky brute with a trunk.  
Wants to bully smaller things and grow a disgusting garden.  
Regenerates any physical harm at will, except that caused by burning.  
Hides disgusting but delicious fungus in his lair.

**Death Spider** (L8) - Huge white spider.  
Wants to catch things in its webs and philosophize with them at length.  
Anyone hit takes a second hit from numbing poison.  
Has a library of old books stashed deep in the webs.

**Scypple** (L1) - Little blue imp.  
Wants to watch from just outside your field of vision and make you look stupid.  
Can turn water it can see to ice.  
Has a few pieces of jewelry stolen from the dead.

**Glow-Puncher** (L3) - Glowing humanoid.  
Wants to scare people by smashing their surroundings, and consume sources of light.  
Gains a level for each light source it consumes, and can disguise itself as a glowing ball.
