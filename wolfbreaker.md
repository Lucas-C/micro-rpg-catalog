Additional rule for ability scores, by [wereoctopus](https://twitter.com/wereoctopus/)

if no d4s are available, ability score generation could be:

1-4: increase appropriate stat  
5: player to the left chooses for you, comes up with a story about how you used the chosen stat to get them out of a scrape.  
6: same, except it's player to the right

[^1]: Note by Bruno Bord: this rule is a bit hard to understand. it simply means that you have 4 attributes, that you can enumerate as 1=Strength, 2=Dexterity, 3=Intelligence, 4=Charisma. Rolling 1, 4 & 2 would mean +1 to STR, DEX & CHA. Rolling 1, 1, 2 would mean +2 to STR & +1 to DEX.
