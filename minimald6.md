# The minimald6 game system

## Roll your attributes with 1d6

Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma.  
These attributes can differ wildly from setting to setting -- when you write something for minimald6, just create the ones you really want to and have to use. These numbers are ballpark. 1=really bad, 6=really good.

You start on Level 2.

## Players

Describe what your character is doing. Roll 2d6. A 5 or 6=successful. +1d6 for advantage of any kind (item, high attribute, superior tactics etc). -1d6 for disadvantage of any kind (low attribute, hinderance).  
Never roll more than 3d6. Never roll less then 1d6.  
Rolls: to hit, to evade, to try, to save, as the DM asks.

## DMs

Play the world and everything in it. Roll for it, if necessary. Success in combat=reduce health by 1 point or narrate what happens (high health=they can take a good amount of damage, low health=weak). Major successes are possible (you decide when it happens and what happens). If it’s likely, don’t roll, it happens. If it’s unlikely, roll for it. If it’s impossible, don’t roll, tell them.  
All rolls change the situation. Skills are likely except when impossible.  
When it‘s dramatically appropriate, a character reaches a new experience level. They may then pick another item from their own list (or, with your OK, from another).

## Optional

Roll 1d6 for each point of Constitution/Health. The sum are your hit points. Small melee weapons do 1d6 damage. Medium melee weapons and firearms do 2d6 damage. Huge melee weapons or firearms do 3d6 damage.

## Creating new games with minimald6

A list of attributes fitting the genre. A list of character classes, best suited for random rolls.

## Creating minimald6 classes

The format is name (2 <--- that's the number of entries on the class list the player is allowed to pick), followed by four or five entries (skills, abilities, background, dark secrets, etc)

### For instance

**Techies** (2): small workshop or garage, mysterious device you don‘t understand, graduated summa cum laude (tech and mechanics), small zapper, knows how to jury-rig

Do not describe abilities or skills or powers. The exact function will come up during play.
