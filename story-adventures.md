# Story Adventures!

by Jamie & Rob Donoghue.

**Requires:** Pencil, note cards, two fate dice.
**Roles:**
GM - The player responsible for describing the world.
Players - Players responsible for describing their character.

To make a character, take a stack of cards.
1. Write the character's name on one
2. Draw a picture on the other
3. When we learn something fun about the character, write it on a card.

Play proceeds with the player telling the story of their character. This is constrained only by the player's sense of story.

The GM may do two things:

1. Ask questions, which the player must answer.
2. Call for a roll of the dice, and resolve it.

## Questions

While questions can be about anything, they will usually be about the world ("Who teaches Arithmency?") or what the character does ("How do you get into the headmaster's office?"). The GM may also capture answers to cards.

## Dice

When the dice are rolled, each face has a meaning:

* -: Something bad happen
* 0: Things go as expected
* +: Something good happens

The GM explains the something good/bad and then play resumes.

## Tips

* Questions have a huge framing power.
* A -- or ++ is usually a sign that it's time to change scenes.
